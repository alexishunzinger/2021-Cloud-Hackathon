- Thank you!
- JupyterHub: close out. 
  - close out your JupyterHub instance if you are finished for the day, following [these instructions](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/clinic/jupyterhub.html#how-do-i-end-my-openscapes-session). 
- Continued work. 
  - You're welcome to continue working beyond the hackathon daily scheduled session, using JupyterHub and Slack. Note that questions in Slack, including `2021-nasacloudhack-help` might have delayed Helper response outside of the daily scheduled cloud hackathon times.
