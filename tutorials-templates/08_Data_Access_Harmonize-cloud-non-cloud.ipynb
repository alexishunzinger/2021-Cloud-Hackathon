This may be a common use case as NASA Earthdata continues to migrate to the cloud, producing a \"hybrid\" data archive across Amazon Web Services (AWS) and original on-premise data storage systems. Additionally, you may also want to combine field measurements with remote sensing data available on the Earthdata Cloud.\n",
