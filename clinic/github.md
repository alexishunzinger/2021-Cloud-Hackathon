# GitHub

*The following was borrowed from the excellent [SnowEx Hackathon 2021](https://snowex-hackweek.github.io/website/projects/index.html)*

## What is GitHub?
[GitHub](https://github.com) is a hosting service for `Git` repositories,
enabling us to share code across teams in a web environment.

## Why do I need a GitHub account?

There are three reasons you are required to have a GitHub account for the hackweek:

1. Your GitHub accounts will give you access to the hackweek cloud computing resources
2. All hackweek tutorials will be shared on GitHub
3. All project teams will use GitHub to collaborate and work together on their code

## Creating a GitHub account

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/).

Next, enter your email address and click on the green 'Sing up for GitHub' button.
You will need to answer a few required questions in the following dialogs.
Be sure to save your password somewhere safe because you will need it later!
The steps for doing this are also well documented on [this](https://help.github.com/en/articles/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership) GitHub help page.


![repos-tab](https://github.com/uwhackweek/jupyterbook-template/raw/main/book/img/repos.png)

Each repository is a container for a specific subset of material for this event. For example, there is a repository for the public-facing website you used to register for this event {{website_url}}. We'll also create new repositories for each project.
